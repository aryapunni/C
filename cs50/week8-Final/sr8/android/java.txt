Java introduction

java code must contain a class (one .java file must contain only one class),
  that class must be the name of the file
  Inside the class contain the main function

Compiling java:
  javac nameofthefile.java
  java nameofthefile

java hello world!:

  class FirstJava {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
      System.out.println("hello world!");
    }
  }

  here FirstJava is the class name and name of the file

data types in java are:
  like C, int char float bool etc also some other data types too

if condition:
    if(title.equals("hello world")){

      System.out.println("wrong message");
      System.out.println("the correct message is: " + title);

    }
    else {
      System.out.println("entered the correct message");
    }

    notice the usage .equals
these notes are not complete, there is notes lot more in detail where android begins, also in the programs itself there are some detailed comments too.
